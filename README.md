# [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) Fast Downloader

**Wabbajack Fast Downloader** is a tool designed to streamline the process of downloading mods for modlists generated by Wabbajack. It extracts mod IDs and file IDs from the Wabbajack modlist JSON file, generates download links, and opens these links in batches for efficient downloading.

> **Project Origin:** This project was inspired by the need for a faster mod downloading process for Wabbajack-generated modlists, originating from [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/issues/17).

## How It Works

1. **Modlist Extraction:** Parses the JSON modlist file to extract mod IDs and file IDs, generating download links for each mod on Nexus Mods.
2. **Batch Download:** Opens the generated download links in batches using the `webbrowser` module to bypass download limits and speed up the process.

## Executable Usage

1. Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/M1n-74316D65/Wabbajack-fast-downloader/releases)

2. Run the executable

3. Select the '*.wabbajack' modlist file

4. Click 'Extract'

5. Click 'Batch Download' to download links in batches

## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
- [Tampermonkey plugin to remove Nexus Mods wait time](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/394039-nexus-no-wait)

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M1n-74316D65/Wabbajack-fast-downloader.git
   ```

2. **Locate and Extract Modlist File:**

   The modlist file is located within the Wabbajack modlist package, e.g., `3.2.0.1\downloaded_mod_lists\wj-featured@@\_tpf-fo4.wabbajack`. Use tools like 7-Zip or PeaZip to extract it.

3. **Place Modlist File:**

   Place the extracted Wabbajack modlist JSON file in the project directory.

4. **Extract Modlist Data:**

   Run the script to generate download links:

   ```bash
   python extract_modlist.py
   ```

   This will create an `output.txt` file with the download links.

5. **Batch Download:**

   Run the batch download script to start downloading mods in batches:

   ```bash
   python batch_download.py
   ```

   The script will open download links in batches. Let the downloads complete, and press Enter in the terminal for the next batch.
